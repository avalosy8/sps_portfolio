       <h1>Yenessa's Portfolio</h1>

       <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
       <p>My name is Yenessa Avalos-Maldonado and I'm sophomore studying Computer Engineering at the University of Florida. I'm passionate about my major and I have a huge interest in the integration between the hardware and software sides of computers and microprocessors.</p>

       <p>Here's me with my parents, who are my number one supporters and are the reason I constantly challenge myself and seek new opportunities.</p>

       <p>I also loooove cats!</p>
       <p>Meet Kido and Puchi!</p>

       <p>Additionally, some of my favorite past times include going on walks, listening to music, hanging out with friends, trying out new things like tennis, and cooking new vegetarian dishes (I know how to make an amazing enchilada dish!).</p>
       <p>Fun fact: two of my hidden talents are painting and violin playing!</p>

       <p>On campus, I'm involved in two engineering organizations called SHPE (Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers) and WECE (Women of Electrical and Computer Engineering). I'm currently the Vice President Internal for WECE.</p>

       <p>This summer I'll be in Fort Collins, Colorado where I'll be experiencing my first internship as an IP Design intern at Intel! I'll be learning SystemVerilog and be working in a Linux/Unix environment.</p>
