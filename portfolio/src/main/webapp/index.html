            <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
            <p>My name is Yenessa Avalos-Maldonado and I'm sophomore studying Computer Engineering at the University of Florida. I'm passionate about my major and I have a huge interest in the integration between hardware and software sides of computers.</p>

            <p>Here's an image with me and my parents, who are my number 1 supporters and are the reason I constantly push myself to succeed and follow my passion.</p>

            <p>I also loooove cats! Here's one of my favorite random cat images. </p>

            <p>And here's an image of my actual cats!</p>

            <p>Some of my favorite past times include going on walks, listening to music, hanging out with friends, trying out new things like tennis and dance, and cooking new vegetarian dishes (I know how to make an amazing enchilada dish!).</p>
            <p>Two of my hidden talents are painting and violin playing!</p>
